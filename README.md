## What is this?

IDK, I'm making a cool browser based on LibreWolf. The goal? Remove the bloat, keep it simple, and make browsing fast and private.

It's just a little project, but if you're into minimal browsers with good privacy, you might like it.

**The idea:**
- No telemetry or tracking stuff
- Fast and lightweight
- Based on LibreWolf (which is already pretty good)
- Just a browser, nothing fancy

## What's different?

- No tracking or telemetry
- Faster than your average bloated browser
- Clean interface (no unnecessary buttons everywhere)
- All the LibreWolf privacy features
- Actually lightweight

## Download

Alpha builds are in the [`Builds`](Builds/) folder. These are early versions, so expect some bugs.

Check [System Requirements](System%20Requirements.md) to see if your system can run it.

## Building it yourself

The source code is in `Builds/0.0.1/librewolf-source/`

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://codeberg.org/Tekalu/Eloy-Browser.git
cd Eloy-Browser

# Go to the source
cd Builds/0.0.1/librewolf-source

# Build it (you'll need the usual browser build tools)
# Follow LibreWolf's build instructions
make build
```

You'll need the standard browser build tools (Git, Python, etc.). It's basically the same as building LibreWolf.

**For detailed build instructions, see the [LibreWolf documentation](https://librewolf.net/docs/).**

## Roadmap (maybe)

- [ ] Add some custom features
- [ ] Make it work on all platforms
- [ ] Stable release someday
- [ ] Whatever else seems cool

## Current Status

It's in alpha. Things might break. Don't rely on it for anything critical yet.
